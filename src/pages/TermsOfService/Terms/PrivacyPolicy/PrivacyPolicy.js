              <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
              <li>
                We do not track users across the web and therefore do not

              </li>
              <li>
                We do not authorize third parties to collect Personal
                Information from visitors of the Website for third party use

              <h2>Security Measures</h2>
              <li>
                We provide commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and
                procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information. For

              <li>
                We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your

                close your account, we will retain your Personal Information for
                a period where it is necessary to continue operating our
                business effectively, to maintain a record of your transactions
                for reporting purposes until this purpose no longer exists, and
                to retain as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
                resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
              </li>
              <h2>Information We Share</h2>
              <li>
                We do not disclose Personal Information we collect about you,
                except as described in this Notice. We may share Personal
                Information with service providers who perform services on our
                behalf (“Third Party Providers”). These Third Party Providers
                are permitted to use or disclose the information only as
                necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal
                requirements. Examples of these service providers include
                entities that process credit card payments, manage and reduce
                our credit risk, verify information, fulfill orders, and provide
                web hosting, analytics and marketing services.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, the Personal Information that you provide will be
                available to us and our agents, representatives, co-branding
                partners, franchisees and licensees (collectively, the “Company
                Parties”). By submitting Personal Information, you grant to the
                Company Parties and the Third-Party Providers a license to use
                such Personal Information for the purposes described in this
                section. The Company Parties and Third-Party Providers may also
                use your Personal Information, alone or in combination with the
                information submitted by other users, to improve Website
                navigation or infrastructure, in internal Bodman_17928070_2
                marketing analyses or reviews, and for other administrative
                purposes. Additionally, unless you notify us to the contrary,
                any Company Party may use your Personal Information in the
                future to provide you with information on products, services,
                special offers and/or deals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
                you are located in Canada, no Company Party will use your
                Personal Information to send you information on products,
                services, special offers and/or deals unless you request to
                receive such information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Further, we may release your Personal Information if we are
                required to do so by law or court order or if we believe in good
                faith that such release is necessary or appropriate to protect
                the rights, property, or safety of our company, customers,
                affiliates, or others. We may also share information or data in
                a form that cannot be used to uniquely identify or contact an
                individual person (“non-personal information”). We may collect,
                use, transfer, and disclose this non-personal information for
                any purposes. Non-personal information that we collect may
                include information regarding your activities on the Website,
                which may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful
                information to our customers and to understand which parts of
                the Website are of most interest.

              <h2>Children</h2>
              <li>
                We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do
                not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under

                limitation, your name, address, email address or any screen name
                or user name you may use. If we learn that we have collected or
                received Personal Information from a child under 13 without
                verification of parental consent, we will delete that
                information. If you believe that we may have any information
                from or about a child under 13, please contact us at the address
                below. Please visit the FTC's website at www.ftc.gov for tips on
